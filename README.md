# Getting started with the demo
-> Clone the below sample repository, or you can use any web application that you have
git clone https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/todoapp-docker.git

-> cd into the directory
cd todoapp-docker/

-> Create an empty file with the name Dockerfile
touch Dockerfile

-> Using the text editor of your choice, paste the below content: 
FROM node:18-alpine AS installer
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install 
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
FROM nginx:latest AS deployer
COPY --from=installer /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

-> Build the docker image using the application code and Dockerfile
docker build -t todoapp-docker .

-> Verify the image has been created and stored locally using the below command:
docker images

-> Create a public repository on hub.docker.com and push the image to remote repo
docker login
docker tag todoapp-docker:latest username/new-reponame:tagname
docker images
docker push username/new-reponame:tagname

-> To pull the image to another environment, you can use the below command
docker pull username/new-reponame:tagname

-> To start the docker container, use the below command
